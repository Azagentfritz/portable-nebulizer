                Portable Nebulizer was founded by a team of healthcare professionals and engineers who 
                recognized the need for more convenient respiratory care options. Inspired by patients who 
                struggled with bulky, noisy, and inefficient traditional nebulizers, our team set out to 
                create a solution that would make respiratory treatments simpler and more accessible.
